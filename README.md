# Show the Local Weather
Show the Local Weather is an Intermediate Front End Development project from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather">freeCodeCamp</a>.

It fulfills the following user stories:
1) I can see the weather in my current location.
2) I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3) I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
